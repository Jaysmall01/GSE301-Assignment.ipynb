# GSE301 Python Project
## Student Academic Performance Analysis System

**Course:** GSE301 – Data Science: Python Fundamentals  
**Institution:** University of Ilorin  
**Project Type:** Individual 
**Student Name:** JAMIU AYOMIDE MUSTAPHA 
**Matric Number:** 22/56FJ054

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Student Academic Performance Analysis System** using
Python fundamentals. The system stores, processes, and analyzes student academic
records and provides insights such as graduation eligibility and top-performing
students.

The project demonstrates practical use of Python programming concepts taught in
GSE301, organized into a real-world academic workflow.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
✔ Variables and data types  
✔ Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets  
✔ Conditional statements (if / elif / else)  
✔ `match-case` pattern matching  
✔ Type casting and validation  
✔ Exception handling (`try/except`)  
✔ List slicing and indexing  
✔ Set operations (union, intersection, difference)  
✔ Logical operators (`and`, `or`)  
✔ Interactive menu system  
✔ Nested dictionary processing
