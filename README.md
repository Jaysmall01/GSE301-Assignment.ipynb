## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Student Academic Performance Analysis System** using
Python fundamentals. The system stores, processes, and analyzes student academic
records and provides insights such as graduation eligibility and top-performing
students.

The project demonstrates practical use of Python programming concepts taught in
GSE301, organized into a real-world academic workflow.
